version Control
Use feature branches. The branch name must be in kebab case (my-super-branch, not my_super_branch). The name must clearly describe what the change consists of.
Commits should preferably do one thing.
Use meaningful commit messages. Remember that commit messages are a help to people who read the code and try to understand why things are done. Good examples: Bug fix: The representative jumps to the bottom of the list when they are updated, Tables for meetings, Make the login button more visible in the menu. Bad examples: Fixed a bug, WIP: Trying to fix representatives
