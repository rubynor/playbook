# playbook
Codestyle, conventions, tools, etc for Rubynor.

The idea is to have a file/folder for each 'type' with an index in this readme file. But until we have more this single file is sufficient

## Git
- create a branch for your feature
- branch prefixes [feature, improvement, fix]
- create PullRequest
- Receive honor and critic, and possibly do some fixes
- Get an approval in form of 'thumbsup' from reviewer
- Merge and deploy to staging/production

## Styles
